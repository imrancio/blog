# Hello world

> Welcome to my home on the internet!

I'm a software engineer professionally, working mostly on frontend, though I'm also fairly comfortable working fullstack. I enjoy working in the JavaScript ecosystem especially React, React Native, NodeJS, GraphQL and TypeScript.

Currently I'm working as a Lead frontend engineer at a fintech startup in India - [**Razorpay**](https://razorpay.com/) - with some amazing folks.

I'll probably come back to fill up this space soon!
