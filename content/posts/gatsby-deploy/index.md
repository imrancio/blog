I've been running this blog on a bare-metal server using Nginx as a reverse proxy to basically serve the static files generated by Gatsby. But now I want to deploy multiple docker services on my VPS, so I decided try using Traefik which is a containerised edge router that can act as a reverse proxy and route multiple services on my personal domain. Unfortunately, my brain is not big enough to understand all these new concepts. So, I decided to document it.

## Goals

First, I should probably plan out what the goals are so I can figure out how to get there:

- Run multiple containerised services on my domain under different subdomains, mainly blog.imranc.io for now
- HTTPS everywhere

There, that seems pretty simple. So lets get on with it.

## Traefik

Traefik is an open-source edge router that will handle web requests sent to my domain.
